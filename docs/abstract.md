# Middleware architectures in PHP with Zend Expressive

Middleware has recently become a must-know concept for PHP developers. With the advent of PSR-7,
which standardized HTTP messages, many frameworks embraced and fostered the spread of such an
approach making it easier for developers to create performant, composable and customizable
software architectures.

In this workshop we will incrementally develop a RESTful API using Zend Expressive, exploring
its components and its workflow. We will discover how the framework allows us to easily create
simple and well organized code, exploiting open source libraries and middleware layers
which could be reused for other projects, even with other frameworks!

At the end of the workshop you can expect to be able to understand middleware and exploit
its advantages. You will be able to integrate, reuse and (why not?) write framework-agnostic
middleware layers to customize your application workflow. Hands on examples and pills of
real world experience will boost your productivity and cut low the entry barrier as well as
helping you avoid common pitfalls.
